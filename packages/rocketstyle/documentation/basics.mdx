# Rocketstyle

Rocketstyle is ultra powerful and extensible styling system for building
React components blazingly fast, easily and make them easily extensible
and reusable.

## Motivation

There are several solutions and helpers but none of them have fit my
needs so far. They were not enough extensible. With Rocketstyle
you can do basically whatever you want while writing less code
and have less hassle in styles in your application.

### Advantages

One of the advantages is that you do not need to import `React` or
`styled-components` in each file where you want to style your
components. You can just import a simple `rocketstyle` component
and extend it as you need in your other components. The composability
is in many cases quite unlimited and you code will be much cleaner.
**Less code, less hassle, huge impact on reuasability and consistency.**

Sounds cool, right? So, let's go through the basics and see how powerful
it can be.

## Installation

You can install ii with your preferred tool (`yarn` or `npm`).

```powershell
# with yarn
yarn add rocketstyle

# or with npm
npm install rocketstyle --save
```

### Dependencies

Rocketstyle depends on the following packages which need to be installed as well.

|                   |         |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| react             | >= 16.3 |
| styled-components | >= 4.0  |

## Getting started

Rocketstyle uses styled-components in the background and basically works
as a wrapper which will generate a `theme` object which will be passed
to a valid styled component.

When you pass any css styles it automatically wraps your component by `styled`
from styled-components and passes all the styles there so it becomes
a regular styled component with its own local `theme` passed as a prop.

### Implement ThemeProvider from styled-components

If you want to use theming, don't forget to add `theme` into your
`ThemeProvider`. There is nothing special to do. Just follow
the styled-components [documentation](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming).

```
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'

<ThemeProvider theme={{/* ...your theme */}}>
  {/* ...your components */}
</ThemeProvider>
```

## Create your first component

```jsx
import rocketstyle from 'rocketstyle'
import Element from './someReactComponent'

export default rocketstyle({
  name: 'Element.Name',
  component: Element
})
  .theme(t => ({
    fontFamily: t.fontFamily.base,
    lineHeight: t.lineHeight,
    color: t.color.gray900
  }))
  .styles(
    css => css`
      ${({ theme: t }) => css`
        line-height: ${t.lineHeight};
        font-family: ${t.fontFamily};
        color: ${t.color};
      `};
    `
  )
```

## Reusability

Imagine you would like to extend the component above. Let's say,
we want to change `line-height` and `color`. We can easily do it
like several ways:

### 1. Passing style properties in theme

We can pass `lineHeight` and `color` in theme object so the styles from
the previous example will be able to access those values.

```jsx
import element from './previous-example-component'

export const NewElement = element
  .config({
    name: 'ReuseElement.name',
  })
  .theme(t => ({
    lineHeight: 3,
    color: t.white
  }))
)
```

### 2. Extending css

We can just pass new css properties to our component.

```jsx
import element from './previous-example-component'

export const NewElement = element
  .config({
    name: 'ReuseElement.name',
  })
  .styles(
    css => css`
      ${({ theme: t }) => css`
        line-height: 2;
        color: black;
      `};
    `
  )
)
```

## Extend component

Rocketstyle uses function chaining so we can just import any rocketstyle
component and simply extend its `states`, `sizes`, `variants`, `theme`,
`styles` and so on. Below is a brief example of extending a component with
additional css properties:

```jsx
import element from './previous-example-component'

export const NewElementA = element
  .config({
    name: 'ExtendElement.newName',
  })
  .styles(
    css => css`
      background-color: black;
    `
  )
)

// extend again NewElementA and create NewElement B
const NewElementB = NewElementA.styles(css => css`text-align: right;`)
```

The `NewElementA` above will look like the previous component but with
black `background-color`.

`NewElementB` will have black background color and text aligned to
the right.

For more composition patterns examples please go through
the documentation so you will see the power of Rocketstyle.
