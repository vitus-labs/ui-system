Perf + correctness audit, round 3 — seven fixes across five packages, identified by a multi-modal codebase audit with 3-judge adversarial verification per finding.

**Correctness fix (kinetic)** — `nextFrame` now returns a canceller that aborts both rAFs. The prior implementation returned only the OUTER rAF id, so cleanup left the inner rAF live and the transition callback fired against potentially-stale or detached elements on fast toggles (open-while-closing, StrictMode double-invoke). All 6 call sites in `Transition` / `TransitionItem` / `TransitionRenderer` updated in lockstep.

**Memory hygiene**
- `styler`: `sheet.insertCache` and `sheet.prepareCache` were keyed by full cssText (200–5000 B per entry) and only cleared by HMR/SSR hooks — long-running SPAs accumulated every unique cssText forever. `evictIfNeeded()` now bounds all three caches via the existing `evictMapByPercent`.
- `kinetic`: `splitCache` (className → string[] memoization) was unbounded module-level Map; now capped at 256 entries with the same oldest-10%-evict pattern.

**Per-render allocations**
- `coolgrid`: `omitCtxKeys` rebuilt a 10-key Set on every Container/Row/Col render (5 components, web + native). Now uses a module-scope `CONTEXT_KEYS_SET`, matching the `omitKeysSet`/`filterAttrsSet` pattern from PR #268.
- `connector-native`: `styled` re-spread `forwardedProps` into `createElement` despite the object being freshly allocated one line earlier and held by no caller. Now mutates directly (mirrors the styler rawProps-mutation trick); also hoists the `shouldForwardProp` resolution to component-creation time.

**Algorithmic / consistency**
- `rocketstyle`: `removeNullableValues` was O(n²) (`.filter().reduce(spread)` allocates a fresh accumulator per step). Now O(n) single-pass, matching the sibling implementation in `@vitus-labs/attrs`.
- `kinetic`: `parseTransformString` allocated a fresh stateful `RegExp` on every call. `TRANSFORM_RE` now hoisted to module scope (mirrors the existing `EASING_NAMES` pattern in the same file); `lastIndex` reset per use.

Verified by 2-of-3 adversarial judges (correctness / perf / safety lenses) per finding, with 9 separate candidates refuted and excluded. Full suite 2730+ pass; 5 new lock-in tests covering the nextFrame canceller and the multi-cache eviction.
